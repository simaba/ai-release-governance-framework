# Overview

This repository provides a lightweight, practical framework for releasing AI-enabled features in regulated or safety-critical environments.

It focuses on:
- Risk-based release readiness (not feature-based)
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Fallback and degraded-mode expectations
- Monitoring and traceability requirements

This is a reference implementation intended for learning, adaptation, and discussion.
